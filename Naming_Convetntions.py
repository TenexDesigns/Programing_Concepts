Naming conventions, such as PascalCase, camelCase, and snake_case, are used to define consistent 
and readable naming patterns for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers in programming languages. 
Each convention has its own rules and is commonly used in different programming languages or communities. 
Lets explore some of the most widely used naming conventions:

  
  
PascalCase (or UpperCamelCase):

Rules: The first letter of each word is capitalized, and there are no separators between the words.
Example: MyClass, EmployeeRecord, CalculateSalary
PascalCase is commonly used in languages like C#, Java, and Ruby for class names and other type declarations.





camelCase (or lowerCamelCase):

Rules: The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of subsequent words is capitalized. 
  There are no separators between the words.
Example: myVariable, calculateSalary, numberOfStudents
camelCase is frequently used in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby for variable and function names.

snake_case:

Rules: Words are written in lowercase, and words are separated by underscores.
Example: my_variable, calculate_salary, number_of_students
snake_case is popular in languages like Ruby, Python, and Rust for variable names and function names.

kebab-case (or spinal-case):

Rules: Words are written in lowercase, and words are separated by hyphens.
Example: my-variable, calculate-salary, number-of-students
kebab-case is often used in CSS, HTML, and URL slugs, but less common in programming language identifiers.

SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:

Rules: Words are written in uppercase, and words are separated by underscores.
Example: MY_CONSTANT, MAX_VALUE, CONFIG_FILE_NAME
SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE is typically used for constants or global variables in languages like Ruby and Python.

Its important to note that the choice of naming convention is often determined by the programming language or 
the style guide of a particular project or community. 
Consistency and readability are key considerations when choosing a naming convention, as it helps make your code more understandable and maintainable.
